# Assignments Page Proposal

- **Header Strip** – Persistent page title, live status badge (e.g., `Online · Next pickup in 15m`), quick actions for toggling auto-assignment, SOS/support, and scanning QR/labels; a sticky layout keeps these controls visible while scrolling.
- **Route Overview Bar** – Horizontal stack of upcoming stops rendered as chips with distance/time badges and a progress indicator; tapping a chip scrolls to the corresponding card and can trigger navigation.
- **Primary Split Pane** – Left: stacked assignment cards grouped by “Ready for pickup,” “In transit,” and “Needs action,” each summarizing pickup/drop-off, packages, earnings, urgency, contact buttons, and a swipe/one-tap workflow to mark pickup or delivery. Right: interactive map showing current position plus pickup/drop-off markers; hovering a card highlights the route segment, and the map snaps to the currently selected assignment.
- **Task Drawer** – Collapsible list of micro tasks (e.g., “Collect signature,” “Verify ID,” “Photo proof”), with quick tap completion, attached notes/photos, and countdown timers for SLA-sensitive chores.
- **Timeline & Activity Feed** – Chronological updates (system events, customer messages, driver actions) with filters for assignment status, allowing drivers to audit progress or catch special instructions.
- **Package Detail Modal** – Deep dive view showing dimensions, handling instructions, barcodes, eco/hazard flags, and a scan-to-confirm checklist to reduce mistakes at pickup/drop-off.
- **Performance Strip** – Compact metrics (earnings today, completed stops, eco score) plus energy or range insights for EV drivers, reinforcing targets and compliance.
